## RevBayes Homework One

1. In Fig. 2, what would each of these distributions say about the skill of the archer? 
Each of the distributions is affected by one parameter, alpha. This 
parameter implies ability of the archer. Where alpha is highest, the 
probability of seeing a distance close to the target is greatest. The 
higher the value of alpha, the more skilled the archer. In this case, an 
archer with an alpha of 2 is the most precise and accurate. 

2. In Fig. 3, why is the number of observations constant?
The number of shots is constant because it is a known variable. No data 
is being added or taken out. 

3. If you were not able to, finish the compilation of RevBayes. Copy the executeable (called rb) into your work directory.
