When we describe the FBD as a mechanistic model, what does that mean? 
How does this contrast to node calibrations?

FBD models uses both morphological, molecular data, and fossil 
occurrence time data to recontruct a phylogenetic tree and estimate divergence dates. Using this data, the FBD allows 
for relationships of extinct taxa to be inferred. In contract to node age prior 
models, the FBD model also takes into account the fossilization rate as a prior.  

When we apply a node calibration, what are we trying to describe?

A node calibration gives an estimate for the minimum age of a node. A prior dentity distribution can be estimated to 
describe the time between a divergence event and the actual age of the oldest fossil.
